# FinTech Bootcamp Capstone Projects

Over the course of Columbia's FinTech Bootcamp, I had the opportunity to complete 3 team capstone projects following the completion of each of the major modules. During each project, I worked with a group of 4-5 fellow students to design, build and present a project that showed a strong grasp of the major theme and the skills and libraries that were presented during each module. The projects allowed us to create our own vision that showcased these skills and implement it within a two-week time frame. For the first two projects, we were tasked with having to use the libraries and knowledge from their respective modules. The third and final capstone project allowed for us to use any skills and libraries from the entirety of the course to complete a final capstone for the bootcamp.

## Module 3: Blockchain Technologies and Cryptocurrency

The final major module of the bootcamp saw the focus shift towards blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies and tokens. Initially, we gained experience using Python to create our own local blockchains and interact with them via Streamlit web applications. Next, we began to work with Solidity and the Ethereum blockchain to develop and deploy Smart Contracts to local instance of the blockchain, created via Streamlit. We also implemented the use of wallets to interact with our Smart Contracts using MetaMask. During the final two weeks, we learnt how to write the contracts used to mint and issue new fungible and non-fungible tokens compliant with ERC20 and ERC721.

### Capstone Project 3: Numisma         (In Progress: Presentation due March 3rd)

Following the completion of the final portion of the bootcamp, I am working with a group of 3 other students to implement a few of the different skills we learnt during the course to create a web application called Numisma. The end goal of our application is to allow users to invest in different cryptocurrency ETFs through the purchase of a non-fungible token. The token will represent the amount that the user is purchasing of the ETF. Our goal is to tailor the ETFs to different major portions of the cryptocurrency market and construct their optimal weights using financial calculations and the efficient frontier.

## Module 2: Machine Learning Applications in Finance

During the second portion of the bootcamp, the focus of the course was on machine learning using Python and how it can be applied to help solve and optimize financial problems. We used both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, as well as deep learning and neural networks, to optimize different applications including loan predictors and algorithmic trading bots. Over the course of the different modules, we were exposed to several different classification and regression models and learned different ways to both implement them and optimize their performance. This portion of the course relied heavily on 3 Python libraries: Scikit-Learn, Keras and TensorFlow.

### Capstone Project 2: Praedico

Having completed the second major module and built and applied machine learning models to several financial applications, I worked with a team of 3 other students to leverage the skills we learned to try predicting the scores of NFL games. The final goal of our project was to predict the outcome of the 2022 NFL Playoffs most accurately and, ultimately, the winner of the Super Bowl. To complete this, we spent a great deal of time collecting and preparing the best data to use when training our model. It was important that we optimized both the information that the data represented and the time frames that it reflected. With the data collected and prepared, we built and trained 4 different models to see which was able to best predict the score of NFL games. With the models built and trained, we created a front-end user application with Streamlit to allow users the ability to test the results of different models for themselves and see who may win the Super Bowl.

## Module 1: Financial Programming with Python

Over the course of the first 2 months of the bootcamp, we learned the basics of financial programming using Python and became familiar with the different libraries used to solve financial problems. The key features of this portion included data collection and preparation using libraries, including Pandas and SQL, and connectiong with and querying data from APIs. We also focused on quantative data analysis and visualization tools to identify and easily display trends within data and calculate key financial ratios and metrics. To achieve this, we used libraries including NumPy, SciPy, MatPlotLib, PyViz and HoloViews.

### Capstone Project 1: Portfolio Analysis Application

[Portfolio Analysis Application](https://github.com/Hashtahg/Project_1_Bootcamp/blob/main/portfolio_analysis.ipynb)

Following the completion of this module, I worked with 4 other students to create a command line portfolio analysis application. The goal of our application was to allow a user to input their risk tolerance and investment amount and be recommended a well-constructed portfolio based on their inputs. To achieve this goal, we used the Alpaca API and Yahoo Finance to identify and build 3 portfolios representing different risk tolerances: low, medium, and high. We then built and implemented a function to calculate the optimal weights for the stocks within each portfolio based on Modern Portfolio Theory and the calculation of the Efficient Frontier. Using the calculated weights, we were then able to provide the user with a forecast for their portfolio's performance based on 95% confidence interval Monte Carlo Simulations. The user was able to see these results in graphs that were outputted to their system.
